# Introduction

Haus Core is a collection of React component libraries that provide developers with pre-built UI elements that can be easily integrated into their NextJS projects. These libraries are designed to help developers save time and improve the quality of their code by providing them with consistent and reusable components.

The Haus Core libraries include a variety of components, such as buttons, forms, modals, navigation menus, and more. Each component is highly customizable and can be easily styled to fit the design of your NextJS project.

To get started with Haus Core, developers can install the specific library they need via NPM and import the components they want to use into their code. This approach allows developers to pick and choose the components they need, rather than having to install and manage a large monolithic library.

By using Haus Core, developers can streamline their development process, improve the consistency of their UI, and create high-quality user interfaces more efficiently.
