# easings

Contains various easing functions for use in animations. Each easing function takes a single argument `x` that represents the progress of the animation as a value between `0` and `1`, and returns a value between `0` and `1` that represents the eased progress of the animation.

## Installation

import { Tab, Tabs } from 'nextra-theme-docs';

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']}>
    <Tab>
        ```bash copy
        npm install @madeinhaus/utils
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ```bash copy
        yarn add @madeinhaus/utils
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ```bash copy
        pnpm add @madeinhaus/utils
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Import

```tsx
import { easings } from '@madeinhaus/hooks';
```

## Functions

- `linear(x: number): number`: Returns the progress of the animation linearly.
- `easeInQuad(x: number): number`: Returns the progress of the animation with a quadratic easing in.
- `easeOutQuad(x: number): number`: Returns the progress of the animation with a quadratic easing out.
- `easeInOutQuad(x: number): number`: Returns the progress of the animation with a quadratic easing in and out.
- `easeInCubic(x: number): number`: Returns the progress of the animation with a cubic easing in.
- `easeOutCubic(x: number): number`: Returns the progress of the animation with a cubic easing out.
- `easeInOutCubic(x: number): number`: Returns the progress of the animation with a cubic easing in and out.
- `easeInQuart(x: number): number`: Returns the progress of the animation with a quartic easing in.
- `easeOutQuart(x: number): number`: Returns the progress of the animation with a quartic easing out.
- `easeInOutQuart(x: number): number`: Returns the progress of the animation with a quartic easing in and out.
- `easeInQuint(x: number): number`: Returns the progress of the animation with a quintic easing in.
- `easeOutQuint(x: number): number`: Returns the progress of the animation with a quintic easing out.
- `easeInOutQuint(x: number): number`: Returns the progress of the animation with a quintic easing in and out.
- `easeInSine(x: number): number`: Returns the progress of the animation with a sine easing in.

## Usage

```tsx copy showLineNumbers
import { easings } from '@madeinhus/utils';

const duration = 1000; // 1 second
const startTime = performance.now();

function animate() {
  const elapsedTime = performance.now() - startTime;
  const progress = Math.min(elapsedTime / duration, 1);
  const easedProgress = easings.easeInOutQuad(progress);
  // Update animation based on eased progress
  if (progress < 1) {
    requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  }
}
requestAnimationFrame(animate);
```

In this example, we import the `easings` object from the `@madeinhaus/utils` module and use the `easeInOutQuad` easing function to ease the progress of an animation over time.
